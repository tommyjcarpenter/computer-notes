After cinnamon Randomly (on some boots, not others!) complaining there's no video acceleration, ran

    inxi -G

Which now shows

    Graphics:  Device-1: NVIDIA GP104 [GeForce GTX 1070] driver: nvidia v: 455.45.01
               Display: x11 server: X.Org 1.20.10 driver: nvidia s-res: 3840x2160
               OpenGL: renderer: GeForce GTX 1070/PCIe/SSE2 v: 4.6.0 NVIDIA 455.45.01


It originally had `"driver: modeset FAILED: nvidia"`

Googled around for that, and eventually found: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=258201

I added these "Files" paths per a comment there:

```
sudo cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf

# nvidia-xconfig: X configuration file generated by nvidia-xconfig
# nvidia-xconfig:  version 455.45.01

Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier     "Layout0"
    Screen      0  "Screen0"
    InputDevice    "Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
    InputDevice    "Mouse0" "CorePointer"
EndSection

Section "Files" < I HAD ADDED THIS, TEMPORARILY
#    ModulePath "/usr/lib/nvidia/xorg"
#    ModulePath "/usr/lib/xorg/modules"
EndSection
```

But then later, I found this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA#DRM_kernel_mode_setting

I went back, commented those out, then added this instead:

```
sudo cat /etc/mkinitcpio.conf

Tue 22 Dec 2020 07:18:40 AM EST
# vim:set ft=sh
# MODULES
# The following modules are loaded before any boot hooks are
# run.  Advanced users may wish to specify all system modules
# in this array.  For instance:
#     MODULES="piix ide_disk reiserfs"
#TOMMY ADDED DEC 22 2020
MODULES="nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm"
```

Then per that article, I did this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA#Pacman_hook

Later on in that comment thread about `Files`, they later linked to this as the proper solution.
